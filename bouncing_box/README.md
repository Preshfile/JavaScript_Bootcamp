<h1>Welcome to My Bouncing Box!</h1>

<p>This is a simple project that replicates the famous bouncing ball screen saver. It is a small demonstration of the power of JavaScript in creating animations on the web. The box is moved diagonally with (0, 0) coordinate (x, y) at the very top left of the screen. The box moves diagonally and each time it reaches a border, it changes direction of the border it touched. If the box is moving bottom-right: when it reaches the bottom border, it will go top; when it reaches the right border, it will go left.</p>

<h2>Task</h2>
<p>The task of this project is to demonstrate how to create a bouncing box animation using JavaScript.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The project consists of an HTML file index.html that contains the bouncing box animation. The div element represents the box, and it is moved by changing its left and top CSS properties. The animation is created by using JavaScript to update the box's position every 50 milliseconds. The box's speed and direction are controlled by the speedX and speedY variables, respectively. When the box reaches a border, the code checks which border it touched and updates the speed variables accordingly, which changes the direction of the box.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>To run this project, simply download the index.html file and open it in a web browser.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Once you have opened the index.html file in a web browser, you will see the bouncing box animation. The box will move diagonally and bounce off the borders of the screen. You can modify the code to change the box's starting position, size, color, and speed to create your own bouncing box animation.</p>
