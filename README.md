<h1>Software Engineering School (Full Stack Development Program)</h1>
<h1>Part One:</h1>
<h2>Bootcamp JS (HTML/CSS, Javascript)</h2>

<p>Qwasarâ€™s Full Stack Development program focuses on front-end and back-end development,<br><br> as well as strong fundamentals in data structures and algorithms. The program is entirely project-based, <br><br>meaning we are expected to develop a strong technical portfolio as well as desired hard and soft skills<br> <br>required for full stack developer jobs in industry.<br><br><br>
Part one (preseason) Covers basic software engineering principles: variables, functions, loop statements, if statements,<br><br> basic algorithms and data structures. Begin using an IDE and the terminal. This track is the equivalent of a coding bootcamp.
