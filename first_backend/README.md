<h1>Welcome to My First Backend</h1>

<h2>Task</h2>
<p>The task is to create a backend using JavaScript Express without a database. The backend should randomly return Frank Sinatra songs (at least 20), and add more pages of his birth, birth city, wife, and picture. The action from the picture should redirect to his picture online with a link already given. Also, add the route for public and protected and then add the route for the listening port.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This project is a simple backend built with JavaScript and Express. It returns a random song from a pool of at least 20 Frank Sinatra songs when the root route is accessed. The backend also has additional pages that display information about Frank Sinatra's birth date, birth city, wife, and picture. The action from the picture should redirect to his picture online with a link already given. Furthermore, the project has a protected route that requires authentication.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>To use this project, first clone the repository from GitHub:</p>

<p>git clone https://github.com/Preshfile/JavaScript_Bootcamp.git
Next, navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:</p>

<p>cd your_project</p>
<p>npm install</p>
<p>Finally, start the server:</p>

<p>node app.js</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>After installing and starting the server, navigate to localhost:8080 in your web browser to access the root route and get a random Frank Sinatra song. To access other pages, add the appropriate route to the URL (localhost:8080/birth_date, localhost:8080/birth_city, localhost:8080/wives, and localhost:8080/picture). To access the protected route, use basic authentication with the username "admin" and the password "admin".</p>
